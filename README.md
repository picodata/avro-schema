# avro-schema [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tarantool/avro-schema.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tarantool/avro-schema)
[Apache Avro](http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.0/spec.html) schema tools for Tarantool, implemented from scratch in Lua

Notable features:
 * Avro defaults;
 * Avro aliases;
 * data transformations are fast due to runtime code generation.

```lua
avro_schema = require('avro_schema')
```

## Creating a Schema
```lua
ok, schema = avro_schema.create {
    type = "record",
    name = "Frob",
    fields = {
      { name = "foo", type = "int", default = 42 },
      { name = "bar", type = "string" }
    }
  }
```
Creates a schema object (`ok == true`). If there was a syntax error, returns `false` and the error message.

## Validating Data by a Schema
```lua
ok, normalized_data_copy = avro_schema.validate(schema, { bar = "Hello, world!" })
```
Returns `true` if the data was valid. If not, returns `false` and the error message.

The function creates a normalized copy of the data. Normalization implies
filling in default values for missing fields.

## Checking if Schemas are Compatible
To facilitate data evolution Avro defines certain schema mapping rules.
If schemas `A` and `B` are compatible, one can convert data from `A` to `B`. 
```lua
ok = avro_schema.are_compatible(schema1, schema2)
ok = avro_schema.are_compatible(schema2, schema1, "downgrade")
```
Allowed modifications include:
  1. renaming types and record fields (provided that `aliases` are correctly set);
  2. extending records with new fields (these fields are initialized with default values, which are mandatory);
  3. removing fields (data simply dropped during conversion);
  4. modifying unions and enums (provided that type definitions retain some similarity);
  5. type promotions are allowed (e.x. `int` is compatible with `long` but not vice versa).
  
Let's assume that `B` is newer than `A`. `A` defines `Apple` (a record type). `B` renames it to `Banana`.
Upgrading data from `A` to `B` is possible, since `Banana` is marked as an alias of the `Apple`. 
Unfortunately, downgrading doesn't work since in `A` the record type `Apple` has no aliases.

To make it work we implement `downgrade` mode. In the downgrade mode, name mapping rules consider
aliases in the source schema (while ignoring aliases in the target schema).

## Compiling Schemas
Compiling a schema creates optimized data conversion routines (runtime code generation).
```lua
ok, methods = avro_schema.compile(schema)
ok, methods = avro_schema.compile({schema1, schema2})
```
If two schemas were provided, generated routines consume data in `schema1` and produce results in `schema2`.

What if the source and destination schemas aren't adjacent revisions, i.e. there were some revisions in-between?
While going from source to destination directly is fast, sometimes it alters the results. Performing conversion
step by step always yields correct results but it is slow.

```lua
ok, methods = avro_schema.compile({schema1, ... schemaN})
```

There is the third option: let `compile` build routines that are fast yet produce the correct results.

## Compile Options
A few options affecting compilation are recognized.

Enabling `downgrade` mode (see `avro_schema.are_compatible` for details):
```lua
avro_schema.compile({schema1, schema2, downgrade = true})
```

Dumping generated code for inspection:
```lua
avro_schema.compile({schema1, schema2, dump_src = "output.lua"})
```

Troubleshooting codegen issues:
```lua
avro_schema.compile({schema1, schema2, debug = true, dump_il = "output.il"})
```

## Generated Routines
`Compile` produces the following routines (returned in a Lua table):
  * `flatten`
  * `unflatten`
  * `flatten_msgpack`
  * `unflatten_msgpack`
  
## Miscelania
Checking if an object is a schema:
```lua
avro_schema.is(object)
```

Quering schema field names (the order matches the field order in the flat representation):
```lua
avro_schema.get_names(schema)
```

Quering schema field types (the order matches `get_names`):
```lua
avro_schema.get_types(schema)
```
